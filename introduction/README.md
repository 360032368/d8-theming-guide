# Introduction

Thanks for downloading this book. A lot of time has gone into writing and finetuning the content of this book. The book has been written for two kinds of people:
- People who are familiar with Drupal 7 theming and want to learn more about how theming has changed in Drupal 8,
- People who are new to Drupal and want to learn how theming in Drupal 8 works.

The book is rather technical and contains lots of code examples.
