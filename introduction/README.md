# Hello world, I'm Sander

Hi, my name is Sander. I'm a web developer from Belgium. At the start of 2014, I got really excited about Drupal. At a local sprint, I had the chance to start contributing and became really excited about my very first patch. I came for the code and stayed for the huge community. I started traveling around Europe to attend various Drupal events. During those travels, I met so many new interesting and talented people. Since I was fairly new, I knew what the hard part was for me when getting started with Drupal. Documentation. Somewhere after the summer of 2014, I decided to start working on a theming guide. What you're reading right now is the result of hours of work and free time.

If you ever want to get in touch, feel free to contact me.
