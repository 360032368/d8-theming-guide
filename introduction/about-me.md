## About the author

Hi, my name is Sander. I'm a web developer from Belgium. At the start of 2014, I got really excited about Drupal. At a local sprint, I had the chance to start contributing. I became really excited when my very first patch got committed. I came for the code and stayed for the community… Later that year, I started traveling around Europe to attend various Drupal events. During those travels, I met so many new interesting and talented people. These amazing people have inspired me during the writing of this book.

## About this book

When I was new to Drupal, I knew that, for me, the hard part when getting started with Drupal was documentation. Somewhere after the summer of 2014, I decided to start working on a theming guide. At first, it was a very small markdown document, a (Github) gist. Since I felt that there was so much to talk about, I decided to split up the document into chapters. Before I knew, a book was born. What you're reading right now is the result of hours of work and free time. If you enjoy reading this book, please let me know. The appreciation from several people has been motivating me to continue working on this book.
