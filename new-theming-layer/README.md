# The new theme layer

Drupal 8 comes with a completely new theme layer. The old theme layer was a big frustration for front-end developers and was far too complex. The most significant change of the new layer is **Twig**. Before diving into this new theming layer, let's take a closer look at the *old* one and sum up some disadvantages.
