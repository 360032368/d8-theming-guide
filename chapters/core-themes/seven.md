## Seven

*Seven* was also introduced in Drupal 7. It is the default administrative theme. The theme was created to improve the Drupal 7 user experience. For Drupal 8, [a style guide for Seven](https://groups.drupal.org/node/283223) was introduced to improve this experience even more and give it a refreshing look.

> Some people might be wondering if this theme should be renamed to `eight`? The answer is **no**.
