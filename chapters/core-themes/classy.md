## Classy

At DrupalCon Austin (2014) the need for a new core theme came up. Here's a brief overview of the meta issue:

> *Create a new core theme (code name "classy") that contains a copy of the all current core template files; this is for the "sensible 2/3" camp. And then modify all of the core/modules template files to contain minimal classes (only those needed for functionality); this would be for the "clean 1/3" camp. To ensure that Seven and Bartik continue to function properly, they should use "classy" as their base theme.*

Classy will be a `base theme` which *Bartik* and *Seven* will extend from.

[Add classy.info.yml to core, set Classy as base theme for Bartik and Seven](https://www.drupal.org/node/2329501)

At DrupalCon Amsterdam, the **classy.info.yml** got commited into Drupal 8 core by Dries. The change record can be found [here](https://www.drupal.org/node/2337467).
