## Stark

*Stark* is core theme that demonstrates Drupal's default markup. It does not contain any template files, so it outputs the layout that come straight out of other (core) modules. This is of course very useful for a developer:
- you can code against Stark when writing CSS for modules
- as a theme developer, you can check against Stark, to see if a layout issue comes from the theme or another module.
