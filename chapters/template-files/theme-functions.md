## Theme functions

This section is dedicated to all people who have been dealing with `theme_`-functions in Drupal 7. All of the `theme_`-function are gone and have been replaced with template files. The next section goes into detail about how you can modify and override these templates. It also handles how you can complety control all the classes add to the layout.

> As you're reading this, it might be possible that some of the `theme_` functions still exists. The goal would be to have all of them removed completly by a first release canditate (Drupal 8 RC1).
