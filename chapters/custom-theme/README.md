# Creating a custom theme

When creating your theme, you have two possibilities. You can create a themeâ€¦

1. using **Classy** as base theme. This will result in some default classes and markup in your template files (since the template files from **Classy** will be used). Of course, you can still override these template files with your own.
2. without **Classy** as base theme. No default markup and classes will be added to the template files. This way, you have full control of all the markup and classes. **This is the default option!**

In the following example, we have two custom themes. The first theme, *Awesome*, uses **Classy** as a base theme. The second theme, *Kitten*, doesn't use **Classy** as a base theme.

> In order to extend from **Classy** in a custom theme, check the documention below (# Using a base theme).
