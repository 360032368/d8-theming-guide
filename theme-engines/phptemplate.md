## PHPTemplate

**PHPTemplate** was the default template engine for Drupal 7. It was written by [Adrian Rossouw](https://www.drupal.org/user/1337/view).

The engine uses individual template files (`*.tpl.php` extension, such as `example.tpl.php`), to theme Drupal's `theme_` functions (`theme_example()`).
