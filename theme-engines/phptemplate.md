## PHPTemplate

**PHPTemplate** was the default template engine in Drupal 7. It was written by [Adrian Rossouw](https://www.drupal.org/user/1337/view).

The engine uses separate template files (`*.tpl.php` extension), like `example.tpl.php`, to override theme Drupal's `theme_` functions, like `theme_example()`.
