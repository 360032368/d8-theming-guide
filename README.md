# The Drupal 8 Theming guide

Drupal 8 is going to be a huge change for the entire community. I created this theming guide to get front-end developers ready for Drupal 8. The entire documentation is writting during my free time.

The first goal of the theming guide is to provide a complete documentation on theming in Drupal 8. Getting you started on creating a custom theme. *The next step will be to include an overview of modern front-end tools and how to intregrate them in your theme. Taking a look at SASS, Compass, Grunt, Browser-sync, … and many other tools. The latest step will be look into front-end performance.*

![With more than 200 new features and improvements, the upcoming release of the world’s leading open source web content management platform will win you over.](https://www.drupal.org/sites/all/modules/drupalorg/drupalorg/images/d8.svg)
