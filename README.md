# The Drupal 8 Theming guide

Drupal 8 is going to be a huge change for anyone familiar with Drupal 7. For themers, as they are called in the Drupal world, there is a whole new theming layer, with Twig as the template engine. This new theming layer is helping Drupal to get of the island it has been on for many years.

The goal of the theming guide is to provide you with a complete overview of the front-end changes in Drupal 8 and to get you started with creating your own custom theme.

![With more than 200 new features and improvements, the upcoming release of the worldâ€™s leading open source web content management platform will win you over.](https://www.drupal.org/sites/all/modules/drupalorg/drupalorg/images/d8.svg)
