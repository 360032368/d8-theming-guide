# The Drupal 8 Theming guide

![This is me](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sqndr/d8-theming-guide/master/img/me.png)

Hi, my name is Sander. I'm a web developer from Belgium. At the start of 2014, I got really excieted about Drupal. At a local sprint, I had the chance to start contributing to Drupal. I came for the code and stayed for the community. I started traveling around Europe to attend various Drupal events. During those travels, I've met so many new interesing and talented people. Since I was fairly new, I knew what the hard part was for me when getting started with Drupal. Documentation. Somewhere after the summer of 2014, before DrupalCon Amsterdam, I decided to start working on a theming guide. What you're reading right now is the result of hours of work and a lot of free time.
