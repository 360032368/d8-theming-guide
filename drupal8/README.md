# Drupal 8

Time to get started with Drupal 8. The development to release a stable Drupal 8 version took about four years. The development phased started March 10, 2011. The first beta was released October 1, 2014, right after the new base theme, Classy, got commit to core. A whole new theming layer should make the life of Drupal themers easier.

Let's take a brief overview of some of the major changes and look at the Drupal coding standards.
