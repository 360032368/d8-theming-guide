# Template files (Twig)

The next section goes into detail about how you can modify and override these templates. It also handles how you can completely control all the classes add to the layout.

> As you're reading this, it might be possible that some of the `theme_` functions still exists. The goal would be to have all of them removed completely by a first release candidate (Drupal 8 RC1).
