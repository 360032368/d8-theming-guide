## Twig debug

A new feature in Drupal core is the the√πe debug tool. It allows developers to trace from which template files certain markup comes. To enable Twig Debugging, all you have to do is set the `debug` variable in the `twig.config ` to `true`.

**sites/default/services.yml**:

    parameters:
      twig.config:
        debug: true # originally false

When opening the web console, HTML comments are added:

    <!-- FILE NAME SUGGESTIONS:
       * html--front.html.twig
       * html--.html.twig
       x html.html.twig
    -->
    <!-- BEGIN OUTPUT from 'core/modules/system/templates/html.html.twig' -->

> A system like this has been backported to **Drupal 7**. It can be activated by adding `$conf['theme_debug'] = TRUE;` inside `settings.php`

### Theme debug suggestions

The files with **(\*)** are theme hook suggestions, and can be used to override the template file in more specific and less generic use cases. The file marked with **(x)** is template file that is currently being used to print the markup.

    <!-- FILE NAME SUGGESTIONS:
       * html--front.html.twig
       * html--.html.twig
       x html.html.twig
    -->
    <!-- BEGIN OUTPUT from 'core/modules/system/templates/html.html.twig' -->

### Finding a variable.

To print all the available variables (in a template file) the `dump()`-function can be used. To print the content of a specific variable you have to pass the name of the variable as a parameter to the function.

Print *all* available variables:

    {{ dump() }}

Print content of `$foo` variable:

    {{ dump(foo) }}
