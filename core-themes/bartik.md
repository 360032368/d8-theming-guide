## Bartik

*Bartik* was introduced in Drupal 7 as a new, clean and simple theme. The theme has some new cool features in Drupal 8 and is also completely responsive. Bartik is the default user-facing theme in Drupal 8.

### Moving Bartik forward

During the development of Drupal 8, the Bartik theme was barely making any progress. For this reason, the maintainership for the theme has changed. [Emma Karayiannis](https://www.drupal.org/u/emma.maria) is the new Bartik maintainer. This happened after the first couple of betas. Since then, Bartik really started to move forward again.
