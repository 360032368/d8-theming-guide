# Drupal core themes

Drupal **core** themes live inside `core/themes`. Inside this folder we can find the four Drupal 8 core themes:

- **bartik**: *A flexible, recolorable theme with many regions and a responsive, mobile-first layout.*
- **seven**: *The default administration theme for Drupal 8 was designed with clean lines, simple blocks, and sans-serif font to emphasize the tools and tasks at hand.*
- **stark**: *An intentionally plain theme with almost no styling to demonstrate default Drupalâ€™s HTML and CSS.*

You might remember these three themes from Drupal 7. But wait, there's more ...

- **classy**: [[meta] Results of Drupalcon Austin's Consensus Banana](https://www.drupal.org/node/2289511): At DrupalCon Austin (2014) the need for a new core theme came up.

Here's an overview of the Drupal 8 core themes:
