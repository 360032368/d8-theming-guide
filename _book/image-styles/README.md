# Image styles

## What is an image style?

Image styles makes it possible for images on a (Drupal) website to have a consistent size, scale, and rotation. They can be seen
as a graphic templates for images of the same kind.

For example, on a social media website, an image style can ensure that all the profile pictures have the same size. The image style can also scale the images, regardless of the pictures that users upload. This way, all profile pictures look the same.
