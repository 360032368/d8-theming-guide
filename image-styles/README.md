# Image styles

## What is an image style?

Image styles makes it possible for image on a (Drupal) website to have a consistent size, scale, and rotation. They can be seen
as a graphic templates for image of the same kind.

For example, on a social media website an image style can ensure that all the profile pictures have the same size. An image style
can also scale, regardless of the pictures that users upload.
